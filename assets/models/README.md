# 3D Models Placeholder

This directory is where port-specific meshes (GLB/GLTF/OBJ) should live. If you have cranes, vessels, or terrain models, drop them here and update any import paths in `PortMap`.

Current demo relies on procedural geometry, so no binary assets are required yet. Keeping this README ensures the folder is versioned so you can simply replace it with your actual models later.
