# Texture Assets Placeholder

Drop any PBR or basic texture maps (albedo, normal, roughness, etc.) used by the digital twin into this folder. Reference them from your Three.js materials or CSS backgrounds as needed.

The base demo uses simple colors, so no texture files ship by default. This placeholder keeps the directory tracked so you can add your own imagery without changing the repo structure.
